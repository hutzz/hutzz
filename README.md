### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year CS student at the University of Windsor. I've also worked for the university as a teaching assistant (![COMP 2660](https://uwindsorcss.github.io/wiki/courses/COMP-2660/overview) and ![COMP 2067](https://uwindsorcss.github.io/wiki/courses/COMP-2067/overview)) and a research assistant in the laboratory of ![Dr. Arunita Jaekel](https://www.uwindsor.ca/science/computerscience/1034/dr-arunita-jaekel). The bulk of my work was related to the detection of position falsification attacks in vehicular ad-hoc networks using machine learning. 

I'm also two-time app dev intern at ![MNP Digital](https://mnpdigital.ca/), where my responsibilities included everything from fullstack ASP.NET, JS, and Python web dev and code analysis, to comparing SAST/DAST tools for developer use, to large-scale PoC projects.
